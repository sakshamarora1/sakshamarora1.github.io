# About

Hi!

I'm a 4th year Engineering student pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology from Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, GGSIPU, Delhi, India.

I'm an aspiring software developer having experience in Python, C++ and Flutter.
I'm passionate about Artificial Intelligence and try to stay up to date with the latest stuff in the tech community!

I'm a football guy. I love playing and watching football when I'm not programming! Apart from this, I'm into fitness and love to work out. :D

My main interests are Machine Learning and AI and I try to work on projects that help me understand this field further.
I'm currently looking for internship oppurtunites in the field of software development and/or machine learning.

If you want to collaborate with me, hit me up! I'm always looking for awesome opportunities!
