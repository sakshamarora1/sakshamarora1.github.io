# About

Hi!

I am a software developer weaving payment and settlement solutions at Juspay! Currently, I'm broadening my horizons around system design and software architecture.

With love for all things tech, I thrive on the thrill of creating innovative solutions that make a positive impact.

Nowadays, I'm mostly diving deep into Docker and Virtualization, also taught myself Go on the go (LOL). I also have an interest in Git and the art of version control. It's like a magical spell that keeps projects in harmony.

Beyond coding, I'm an avid learner, constantly exploring new technologies and trends. This curiosity fuels my passion for growth and enables me to continually expand my skills!

When I'm not programming, I'm up for a mind-bending chess match. Challenge me on chess.com [here](https://www.chess.com/member/sakshamarora1001) if you dare!
Video games like Valorant, Assassin's Creed, and Dishonoured are my go-to virtual adventures :)
