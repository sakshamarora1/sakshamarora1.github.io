# First blog


# Work in Progress!

I have created this website using the hugo static website generator https://gohugo.io/ and is still a work in progress! : D
I am currently using the LoveIt theme https://themes.gohugo.io/loveit/ by [Dillon](https://github.com/dillonzq)

I will be documenting my GSoC'2020 journey and adding descriptions about my projects in the coming weeks!

I have also been posting GSoC related blogs on https://blogs.python-gsoc.org/en/sakshamaroras-blog, you can check them out!
